This is my attempt at a LabROSA LaTeX poster template.  It's really just a
repackaging of the a0poster style-file with LabROSA-specific stuff.  It's all
pretty generic at the moment, although you'll probably want to replace refs.bib
with your own BiBTeX file.  

There's probably a cleaner way to build the final PDF, but here's what I do:

1) latex poster.tex
2) dvips -Ppdf poster.dvi -o poster.ps
3) ps2pdf poster.ps poster.pdf

or you can just run the included shell script, 'mkpdf.sh'.
