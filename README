MAIN IDEA:

- grap EchoNest features on a lot of songs

- do clustering using.... something?

- see if we find patterns

This is a work in progress, and the code makes nonsense without comments. Please write us if you're interested in something similar, we'd be happy to explain, collaborate, give feedback, etc

Cheers!
